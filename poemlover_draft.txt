Goal: let players see the End Poem **every time** they go through the
 exit portal

Side: Client only

Targeted users: >=1.18.2, Fabric/Forge/Quilt/Neo

Why is it available on clients:
 When jumping into the portal, server simply sends a packet:
 `ClientboundGameEventPacket.WIN_GAME(param: float)`. It is client that
 decides to respawn immediately when `param` in [-0.5, 0.5), or see the poem and respawn
 on close when `param` in [0.5, 1.5). In short, it is client that decides when to respawn
 (according to `param` value in Vanilla clients).

To hack the client:
 Find ClientPacketListener#handleGameEvent. clientboundGameEventPacket refers to arg1.
 Redirect clientboundGameEventPacket.getParam(): when
  clientboundGameEventPacket.getEvent() equals `WIN_GAME`, return `1.1451F`
